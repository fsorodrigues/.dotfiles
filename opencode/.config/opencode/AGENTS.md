# AGENTS.md - AI Coding Agent Guidelines

This document provides global guidelines for AI coding agents working.

## Subagents

Always check it there are specialized subagents that you can delegate to. 

There should be a docs subagent that can be used to create documentation files.

There can also be project-specific subagents available for special tasks, such
as the svelte-file-editor subagent for Svelte projects.
